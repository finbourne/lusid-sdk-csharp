# Lusid.Sdk.Model.LoanFacility
Loan Facility. This is a very lightweight instrument which acts as a placeholder for the state that is built  from the instrument events. The facility acts as an agreement between a single borrower and many lenders (investors).  Several contracts may be drawn up to enable the lending of funds to the borrower. These contracts are modelled via  FlexibleLoan instruments in LUSID. The instrument events on the facility may relate to the facility as a whole  (for example to define a global commitment amount), or they may relate to a single contract (such as a paydown  transaction on a particular contract).
