# Lusid.Sdk.Model.HullWhiteModelOptions
Model options for the Hull-White one-factor lattice pricer.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ModelOptionsType** | **string** | Available values: Invalid, OpaqueModelOptions, EmptyModelOptions, IndexModelOptions, FxForwardModelOptions, FundingLegModelOptions, EquityModelOptions, CdsModelOptions, FlexibleLoanPricerOptions, HullWhiteModelOptions, BondLookupModelOptions, BondForwardModelOptions, SimpleModelOptions. | 
**MeanReversion** | **decimal** | The mean reversion speed of the short rate. Must be strictly positive. Defaults to 0.03. | [optional] 
**Volatility** | **decimal** | The normal (absolute) volatility of the short rate, e.g. 0.008 for 80bp per year. Must not  be negative; zero is allowed and prices with a deterministic short rate. Defaults to 0.008. | [optional] 
**LatticeSteps** | **int** | The number of uniform time steps in the lattice. More steps give a finer discretisation  of the short-rate process at greater computational cost. Defaults to 200. | [optional] 
**EffectiveRateBumpSize** | **decimal?** | The parallel curve shift, as an absolute rate, used for the central-difference effective  duration and convexity, e.g. 0.0001 for a 1bp bump. Must be strictly positive.  Defaults to 0.0025 (25bp, the market convention for option-adjusted risk) when not supplied. | [optional] 
**MeanReversionByCurrency** | **Dictionary&lt;string, decimal&gt;** | Per-currency mean-reversion overrides, keyed by ISO currency code.  A currency absent from this map uses MeanReversion. | [optional] 
**VolatilityByCurrency** | **Dictionary&lt;string, decimal&gt;** | Per-currency short-rate volatility overrides, keyed by ISO currency code.  A currency absent from this map uses Volatility. Short-rate volatility is a per-currency  quantity in practice, so a book spanning several currencies can calibrate each currency  separately instead of sharing a single global figure. | [optional] 
**VolatilityMultiplier** | **decimal?** | A multiplicative scaling applied to the resolved short-rate volatility - the scalar  Volatility or its per-currency override, whichever applies - at the point of use, e.g. 1.1  prices with the configured volatility raised by ten percent. A single multiplier scales  every per-currency calibration coherently, so a shocked set of options can differ from its  base by this one field rather than a hand-rebuilt volatility (or map of volatilities).  Must not be negative; zero is allowed and prices with a deterministic short rate.  Defaults to 1, which reproduces the configured volatility exactly, when not supplied. | [optional] 
**EffectiveCs01BumpWidth** | **decimal?** | The TOTAL width, as an absolute spread, of the central-difference stencil used for the  option-adjusted Analytic/EffectiveCS01: the two reprice points sit at the solved OAS plus  and minus half of this. The reported figure is normalised to a one-basis-point move  whatever width is configured. Must be strictly positive. Defaults to 0.0001 (1bp, the  market convention for a credit sensitivity) when not supplied. | [optional] 
**EffectiveKeyRateBuckets** | **List&lt;string&gt;** | The maturity buckets of the Analytic/EffectiveKeyRateDuration ladder, as tenor strings  such as \&quot;1Y\&quot; or \&quot;6M\&quot;, in strictly increasing order. Each bucket is repriced under a  tent-shaped curve shift centred on its own tenor, so the ladder sums to the parallel  effective duration to first order. Buckets past an instrument&#39;s maturity report zero, so  one grid can serve a whole book. Defaults to the 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 20Y, 30Y grid  when not supplied; an empty list is rejected. | [optional]
