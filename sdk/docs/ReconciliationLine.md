# Lusid.Sdk.Model.ReconciliationLine
In evaluating a left and right hand side holding or valuation set, two data records result. These are then compared based on a set of  rules. This results in either a match or failure to match. If there is a match both left and right will be present, otherwise one will not.  A difference will be present if a match was calculated.  The options used in comparison may result in elision of results where an exact or tolerable match is made.
