# Lusid.Sdk.Model.InlineValuationsReconciliationRequest
Specification for the reconciliation request. Left and Right hand sides are constructed. Each consists of a valuation of a inline set of instruments using an inline aggregation request. The results of this can then be compared to each other. The difference, which is effectively a risk based difference allows comparison of the effects of changing a recipe, valuation date, or (though it may or may not make logical sense) a set of instruments.
