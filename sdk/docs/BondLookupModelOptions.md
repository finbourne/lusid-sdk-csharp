# Lusid.Sdk.Model.BondLookupModelOptions
Model options for the quote-anchored bond lookup pricer.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ModelOptionsType** | **string** | Available values: Invalid, OpaqueModelOptions, EmptyModelOptions, IndexModelOptions, FxForwardModelOptions, FundingLegModelOptions, EquityModelOptions, CdsModelOptions, FlexibleLoanPricerOptions, HullWhiteModelOptions, BondLookupModelOptions, BondForwardModelOptions. | 
**SpreadAnchoredRisk** | **bool** | Price the bond by discounting its own cashflows over its discounting curve at a constant  spread, instead of marking it to its quoted price. Marking to a quote declares no curve  dependency, so a lookup-priced bond reports no curve delta at all. In this mode the pricer  declares both the discounting curve and a ZSpread quote for the instrument and prices off  them, so holding the spread fixed while the curve is perturbed produces the curve&#39;s delta.  Off by default, as the mode changes both the declared dependencies and where the price  comes from. | 
**Cs01BumpWidth** | **decimal?** | The TOTAL width of the central-difference stencil behind the CS01/Central measure: the  instrument&#39;s own z-spread is repriced at spread ± width/2, so a width of 0.0001 means  ±0.5bp reprice points. The width is the whole distance between the two reprice points,  NOT the half-shift. The reported measure is always per one basis point of widening  whatever width is configured. Must be strictly positive.  Defaults to 0.0001 (1bp, repriced at ±0.5bp) when not supplied. | [optional] 

```csharp
using Lusid.Sdk.Model;
using System;

bool spreadAnchoredRisk = //"True";

BondLookupModelOptions bondLookupModelOptionsInstance = new BondLookupModelOptions(
    spreadAnchoredRisk: spreadAnchoredRisk,
    cs01BumpWidth: cs01BumpWidth);
```
