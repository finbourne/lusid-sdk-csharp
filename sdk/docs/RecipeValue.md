# Lusid.Sdk.Model.RecipeValue
Recipe value represents a data that is then used to perform an atomic operation which is then used in composition of Configuration Recipe.  This object either includes the data itself (in json form or as simple string) or is a reference where the data can be obtained from (from a Configuration Recipe say).  Only one field is to be populated.
