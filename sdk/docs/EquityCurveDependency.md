# Lusid.Sdk.Model.EquityCurveDependency
For indicating a dependency on an EquityCurve.  E.g. When pricing an EquitySwap one may want to make predictions about the price of the underlying equity at future dates.  If so, that model would declare an EquityCurve dependency so that it could obtain predictions from the EquityCurve.
