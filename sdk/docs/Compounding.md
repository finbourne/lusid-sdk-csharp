# Lusid.Sdk.Model.Compounding
The compounding settings used on interest rate.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AveragingMethod** | **string** | Defines whether a weighted or unweighted average is used when calculating the average rate.  It applies only when CompoundingMethod &#x3D; ‘Averaging‘.    Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Unweighted, Weighted]. | [optional] 
**CalculationShiftMethod** | **string** | Defines which resets and day counts are used for the rate calculation    Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Lookback, NoShift, ObservationPeriodShift, Lockout]. | [optional] 
**CompoundingMethod** | **string** | If the interest rate is simple, compounded or using a pre-computed compounded index.    Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Averaging, Compounding, CompoundedIndex]. | 
**ResetFrequency** | **string** | The interest payment frequency. | 
**Shift** | **int** | Defines the number of days to lockout or shift observation period by - should be a non-negative integer | [optional] 
**SpreadCompoundingMethod** | **string** | Defines how the computed leg spread is applied to compounded rate.  It applies only when CompoundingMethod &#x3D; ‘Compounding‘ or ‘CompoundedIndex‘.    Available compounding methods:    | Method | Description |  | - -- -- - | - -- -- -- -- -- |  | Straight | Compounding rate in each compound period includes the spread. |  | Flat | Compounding rate does not include the spread, and the spread is used for simple interest in each compound period. |  | SpreadExclusive | Compounding rate does not include the spread, and the spread is used for simple interest for whole accrual period. |    The values \&quot;IsdaCompounding\&quot;, \&quot;NoCompounding\&quot;, \&quot;IsdaFlatCompounding\&quot;, and \&quot;None\&quot; are accepted for compatibility  with existing instruments and their use is discouraged.    Supported string (enumeration) values are: [Straight, IsdaCompounding, NoCompounding, SpreadExclusive, IsdaFlatCompounding, Flat, None]. | [optional]
