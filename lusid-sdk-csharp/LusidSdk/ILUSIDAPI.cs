    /// # Introduction
    ///
    /// This page documents the [LUSID
    /// APIs](https://api.finbourne.com/swagger), which allows authorised
    /// clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.
    ///
    /// SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following
    /// languages :
    ///
    /// * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp)
    /// * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java)
    /// * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js)
    /// * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python)
    ///
    /// # Data Model
    ///
    /// The LUSID API has a relatively lightweight but extremely powerful data
    /// model.   One of the goals of LUSID was not to enforce on clients a
    /// single rigid data model but rather to provide a flexible foundation
    /// onto which clients can streamline their data.   One of the primary
    /// tools to extend the data model is through using properties.  Properties
    /// can be associated with amongst others: -
    /// * Transactions
    /// * Instruments
    /// * Portfolios
    ///
    /// The LUSID data model is exposed through the LUSID APIs.  The APIs
    /// provide access to both business objects and the meta data used to
    /// configure the systems behaviours.   The key business entities are: -
    /// * **Portfolios**
    /// A portfolio is the primary container for transactions and holdings.
    /// * **Derived Portfolios**
    /// Derived portfolios allow portfolios to be created based on other
    /// portfolios, by overriding or overlaying specific items
    /// * **Holdings**
    /// A holding is a position account for a instrument within a portfolio.
    /// Holdings can only be adjusted via transactions.
    /// * **Transactions**
    /// A Transaction is a source of transactions used to manipulate holdings.
    /// * **Corporate Actions**
    /// A corporate action is a market event which occurs to a instrument, for
    /// example a stock split
    /// * **Instruments**
    /// A instrument represents a currency, tradable instrument or OTC contract
    /// that is attached to a transaction and a holding.
    /// * **Properties**
    /// Several entities allow additional user defined properties to be
    /// associated with them.   For example, a Portfolio manager may be
    /// associated with a portfolio
    ///
    /// Meta data includes: -
    /// * **Transaction Types**
    /// Transactions are booked with a specific transaction type.  The types
    /// are client defined and are used to map the Transaction to a series of
    /// movements which update the portfolio holdings.
    /// * **Properties Types**
    /// Types of user defined properties used within the system.
    ///
    /// This section describes the data model that LUSID exposes via the APIs.
    ///
    /// ## Scope
    ///
    /// All data in LUSID is segregated at the client level.  Entities in LUSID
    /// are identifiable by a unique code.  Every entity lives within a logical
    /// data partition known as a Scope.  Scope is an identity namespace
    /// allowing two entities with the same unique code to co-exist within
    /// individual address spaces.
    ///
    /// For example, prices for equities from different vendors may be uploaded
    /// into different scopes such as `client/vendor1` and `client/vendor2`.  A
    /// portfolio may then be valued using either of the price sources by
    /// referencing the appropriate scope.
    ///
    /// LUSID Clients cannot access scopes of other clients.
    ///
    /// ## Schema
    ///
    /// A detailed description of the entities used by the API and parameters
    /// for endpoints which take a JSON document can be retrieved via the
    /// `schema` endpoint.
    ///
    /// ## Instruments
    ///
    /// LUSID has its own built-in instrument master which you can use to
    /// master your own instrument universe.
    ///
    /// Every instrument must be created with one or more unique market
    /// identifiers, such as [FIGI](https://openfigi.com/) or RIC code. For any
    /// non-listed instruments (eg OTCs), you can upload an instrument against
    /// a custom ID of your choosing.
    ///
    /// In addition, LUSID will allocate each instrument a unique 'LUSID
    /// instrument identifier'. The LUSID instrument identifier is what is used
    /// when uploading transactions, holdings, prices, etc. The API exposes an
    /// `instrument/lookup` endpoint which can be used to lookup these LUSID
    /// identifiers using their market identifiers.
    ///
    /// Cash can be referenced using the ISO currency code prefixed with
    /// "`CCY_`" e.g. `CCY_GBP`
    ///
    /// ## Instrument Prices (Analytics)
    ///
    /// Instrument prices are stored in LUSID's Analytics Store
    ///
    /// | Field|Type|Description |
    /// | ---|---|--- |
    /// | InstrumentUid|string|Unique instrument identifier |
    /// | Value|decimal|Value of the analytic, eg price |
    /// | Denomination|string|Underlying unit of the analytic, eg currency, EPS
    /// etc. |
    ///
    ///
    /// ## Instrument Data
    ///
    /// Instrument data can be uploaded to the system using the [Instrument
    /// Properties](#tag/InstrumentProperties) endpoint.
    ///
    /// | Field|Type|Description |
    /// | ---|---|--- |
    /// | InstrumentUid|string|Unique instrument identifier |
    ///
    ///
    /// ## Portfolios
    ///
    /// Portfolios are the top-level entity containers within LUSID, containing
    /// transactions, corporate actions and holdings.    The transactions build
    /// up the portfolio holdings on which valuations, analytics profit &amp;
    /// loss and risk can be calculated.
    /// Properties can be associated with Portfolios to add in additional model
    /// data.  Portfolio properties can be changed over time as well.  For
    /// example, to allow a Portfolio Manager to be linked with a Portfolio.
    ///
    /// Additionally, portfolios can be securitised and held by other
    /// portfolios, allowing LUSID to perform "drill-through" into underlying
    /// fund holdings
    ///
    /// ### Reference Portfolios
    /// Reference portfolios are portfolios that contain only holdings or
    /// weights, as opposed to transactions, and are designed to represent
    /// entities such as indices.
    ///
    /// ### Derived Portfolios
    ///
    /// LUSID also allows for a portfolio to be composed of another portfolio
    /// via derived portfolios.  A derived portfolio can contain its own
    /// transactions and also inherits any transactions from its parent
    /// portfolio.  Any changes made to the parent portfolio are automatically
    /// reflected in derived portfolio.
    ///
    /// Derived portfolios in conjunction with scopes are a powerful construct.
    /// For example, to do pre-trade what-if analysis, a derived portfolio
    /// could be created a new namespace linked to the underlying live (parent)
    /// portfolio.  Analysis can then be undertaken on the derived portfolio
    /// without affecting the live portfolio.
    ///
    /// ### Portfolio Groups
    /// Portfolio groups allow the construction of a hierarchy from portfolios
    /// and groups.  Portfolio operations on the group are executed on an
    /// aggregated set of portfolios in the hierarchy.
    ///
    /// For example:
    ///
    /// * Global Portfolios _(group)_
    /// * APAC _(group)_
    /// * Hong Kong _(portfolio)_
    /// * Japan _(portfolio)_
    /// * Europe _(group)_
    /// * France _(portfolio)_
    /// * Germany _(portfolio)_
    /// * UK _(portfolio)_
    ///
    /// In this example **Global Portfolios** is a group that consists of an
    /// aggregate of **Hong Kong**, **Japan**, **France**, **Germany** and
    /// **UK** portfolios.
    ///
    /// ### Movements Engine
    /// The Movements engine sits on top of the immutable event store and is
    /// used to manage the relationship between input trading actions and their
    /// associated portfolio holdings.
    ///
    /// The movements engine reads in the following entity types:-
    /// * Posting Transactions
    /// * Applying Corporate Actions
    /// * Holding Adjustments
    ///
    /// These are converted to one or more movements and used by the movements
    /// engine to calculate holdings.  At the same time it also calculates
    /// running balances, and realised P&amp;L.  The outputs from the movements
    /// engine are holdings and transactions.
    ///
    /// ## Transactions
    ///
    /// A transaction represents an economic activity against a Portfolio.
    ///
    /// Transactions are processed according to a configuration. This will tell
    /// the LUSID engine how to interpret the transaction and correctly update
    /// the holdings. LUSID comes with a set of transaction types you can use
    /// out of the box, or you can configure your own set(s) of transactions.
    ///
    /// For more details see the [LUSID Getting Started Guide for transaction
    /// configuration.](https://support.finbourne.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016737511-Configuring-Transaction-Types)
    ///

    /// | TransactionId|string|Unique transaction identifier |
    /// | Type|string|LUSID transaction type code - Buy, Sell, StockIn,

    /// ### Example Transactions
    ///
    /// #### A Common Purchase Example
    /// Three example transactions are shown in the table below.
    ///
    /// They represent a purchase of USD denominated IBM shares within a
    /// Sterling denominated portfolio.
    ///
    /// * The first two transactions are for separate buy and fx trades
    /// * Buying 500 IBM shares for $71,480.00
    /// * A foreign exchange conversion to fund the IBM purchase. (Buy
    /// $71,480.00 for &amp;#163;54,846.60)
    /// * The third transaction is an alternate version of the above trades.
    /// Buying 500 IBM shares and settling directly in Sterling.

    ///
    /// #### A Forward FX Example
    ///
    /// LUSID has a flexible transaction modelling system, and there are a
    /// number of different ways of modelling forward fx trades.
    ///
    /// The default LUSID transaction types are FwdFxBuy and FwdFxSell. Other
    /// types and behaviours can be configured as required.
    ///
    /// Using these transaction types, the holdings query will report two
    /// forward positions. One in each currency.
    ///
    /// Since an FX trade is an exchange of one currency for another, the
    /// following two 6 month forward transactions are equivalent:
    ///
    /// | Column |  Forward 'Sell' Trade | Forward 'Buy' Trade |
