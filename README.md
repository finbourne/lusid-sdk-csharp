# LUSID<sup>®</sup> C# SDK

This repository enables the generation of a C# SDK from the FINBOURNE OpenAPI specification using the [autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) tool.

A generated version of the SDK is included in the `lusid-sdk-csharp` folder based on the OpenAPI specification named `lusid.json` in the root folder.  The most up to date version of the OpenAPI specification can be downloaded from https://api.finbourne.com/swagger/v0/swagger.json

In addtion to the SDK, a set of examples on how to use the SDK can be found in the [LusidSdk.Tests](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp/tree/master/lusid-sdk-csharp/LusidSdk.Tests) folder.  These exist in the form of unit tests and further instructions on running the tests can be found in the [README](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp/blob/master/lusid-sdk-csharp/readme.md).

# Generating the SDK

The preferred method of generating the SDK is using `docker` and `docker-compose` by running the following command: 

```
$ docker-compose up && docker-compose rm -f
```

If `docker` is not available then the SDK can be generated using `autorest` natively using the following command, ensuring this `README.md` is in the same folder as the command is run from:

```
$ autorest --csharp --use=@microsoft.azure/autorest.modeler@2.3.40
```

For other options on installation see [Installing AutoRest](https://aka.ms/autorest/install) on the AutoRest github page.
